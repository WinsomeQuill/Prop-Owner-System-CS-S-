# Props System Owner [CS:Source v90]

This plugin is suitable for a zombie server(Zombie Reloaded, Zombie Plague and etc...). 
The essence of the plugin is that Human cannot break Humans props (exception: Owner), and Zombie props are Zombies (exception: Owner).
If the prop owner is dead, then the prop goes to the server and any player can break it.
